## üöÄ What is SeerrBridge?

üåâ **SeerrBridge** is a browser automation tool that integrates [Jellyseer](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)/[Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) with [Debrid Media Manager](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/debrid-media-manager). It listens to movie requests via Overseerr webhook. It automates the torrent search and download process using Debrid Media Manager via browser automation, which in turn, gets sent to Real-Debrid. This streamlines your media management, making it fast and efficient.

<details>
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è Why SeerrBridge?</summary>

**SeerrBridge** eliminates the need to set up multiple applications like [Radarr](https://radarr.video/), [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett), [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr), and other download clients. With SeerrBridge, you streamline your media management into one simple, automated process. No more juggling multiple tools‚Äîjust request and download!

Simply put, I was too lazy to set up all of these other applications (arrs) and thought.... I want this instead.

### üê≥ Docker Support

SeerrBridge consists of two components: the main application (seerrbridge) and an optional dashboard (bridgeboard). The recommended way to run them is using Docker Compose with the pre-built images.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A `.env` file with your configuration

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml file**:

```yaml
services:
  seerrbridge:
    image: ghcr.io/woahai321/seerrbridge:latest
    container_name: seerrbridge
    ports:
      - "8777:8777"
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    volumes:
      - shared_logs:/app
      - ./.env:/app/.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: >
      sh -c "
        cat /app/.env > /dev/null && 
        echo 'Starting SeerrBridge with refreshed env' &&
        uvicorn seerrbridge:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8777
      "
    networks:
      - seerrbridge_network

  bridgeboard:
    image: ghcr.io/woahai321/bridgeboard:latest
    container_name: bridgeboard
    ports:
      - "3777:3777"
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    volumes:
      - shared_logs:/seerrbridge_data
      - ./.env:/app/.env
    environment:
      - SEERRBRIDGE_URL=http://seerrbridge:8777
      - SEERRBRIDGE_LOG_PATH=/seerrbridge_data/logs/seerrbridge.log
    entrypoint: >
      sh -c "
        mkdir -p /app && 
        ln -sf /seerrbridge_data/seerrbridge.log /app/logs/seerrbridge.log &&
        ln -sf /seerrbridge_data/episode_discrepancies.json /app/episode_discrepancies.json &&
        npm start
      "
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - seerrbridge
    networks:
      - seerrbridge_network

volumes:
  shared_logs:

networks:
  seerrbridge_network:
    driver: bridge
```

2. **Create or edit your `.env` file**:

```bash
RD_ACCESS_TOKEN={"value":"YOUR_TOKEN","expiry":123456789}
RD_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
RD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
RD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
TRAKT_API_KEY=YOUR_TRAKT_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_API_KEY=YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_BASE=https://YOUR_OVERSEERR_URL.COM
HEADLESS_MODE=true
ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_BACKGROUND_TASK=true
ENABLE_SHOW_SUBSCRIPTION_TASK=true
REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES=120
TORRENT_FILTER_REGEX=^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
MAX_MOVIE_SIZE=0
MAX_EPISODE_SIZE=0
```

3. **Start the containers**:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. **Access the applications**:
   - SeerrBridge API: [http://localhost:8777](http://localhost:8777)
   - BridgeBoard Dashboard: [http://localhost:3777](http://localhost:3777)

### Configuration Notes

- **Volumes**: The configuration creates a `config` directory to persist SeerrBridge data
- **Networks**: Both containers are placed on the same network so they can communicate
- **Environment Variables**: The bridgeboard container is configured to connect to the seerrbridge container using the internal Docker network
- **Restart Policy**: Containers will restart automatically unless manually stopped
---

***IF YOU ARE USING OVERSEERR IN DOCKER AND SEERRBRIDGE IN DOCKER, YOUR WEBHOOK IN OVERSEERR NEEDS TO BE THE DOCKER CONTAINER IP***

To find the IP of the SeerrBridge Docker container do the following:

```bash
docker ps
```

You will see the container and ID

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dac5fb21-89a7-42ff-8e73-911a6b8ee149)

Grab the ID and do

```bash
docker inspect YOUR-ID
```

You will see the ID in the response:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9a67170-748b-4c44-b37c-86a820e8d09a)

This will determine your Overseerr Webhook URL i.e. HTTP://DOCKER-CONTAINER-IP:8077/jellyseer-webhook/

---



## Docker Network Configuration

### Steps to Align Containers on the Same Network

1. **Check Container Networks:**
   Run the following command to list the containers and their associated networks:
   ```bash
   docker ps --format '{{ .ID }} {{ .Names }} {{ json .Networks }}'
   ```
   This will display the container IDs, names, and the networks they are connected to.

2. **Disconnect the Container from Its Current Network:**
   Use the following command to disconnect a container from its current network:
   ```bash
   docker network disconnect NETWORK_NAME CONTAINER_ID
   ```
   Replace `NETWORK_NAME` with the name of the network the container is currently on, and `CONTAINER_ID` with the ID of the container.

3. **Connect the Container to the Desired Network:**
   Use the following command to connect the container to the target network:
   ```bash
   docker network connect TARGET_NETWORK_NAME CONTAINER_ID
   ```
   Replace `TARGET_NETWORK_NAME` with the name of the network you want the container to join (e.g., `overseerr`), and `CONTAINER_ID` with the ID of the container.

4. **Verify the Changes:**
   Run the `docker ps --format '{{ .ID }} {{ .Names }} {{ json .Networks }}'` command again to confirm that both containers are now on the same network.

### Example
To move a container with ID `abc123` from its current network to the `overseerr` network:
```bash
docker network disconnect current_network abc123
docker network connect overseerr abc123
```

### Notes
- Ensure both containers are connected to the same network after completing the steps.
- If the containers are still not communicating, double-check the network configuration and ensure no firewall rules are blocking the connection.

---

That's it! Your **SeerrBridge** container should now be up and running. üöÄ

<details>
<summary>üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap</summary>

- [ ] **Faster Processing**: Implement concurrency to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- [x] **TV Show Support**: Extend functionality to handle TV series and episodes.
- [x] **DMM Token**: Ensure access token permanence/refresh
- [x] **Jellyseer/Overseer API Integration**: Direct integration with Jellyseer/Overseer API for smoother automation and control.
- [x] **Title Parsing**: Ensure torrent titles/names are properly matched and handle different languages.
- [x] **Docker Support**: Allow for Docker / Compose container.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üîç How It Works</summary>

1. **Seerr Webhook**: SeerrBridge listens for movie requests via the configured webhook.
2. **Automated Search**: It uses Selenium to automate the search for movies on Debrid Media Manager site.
3. **Torrent Fetching**: Once a matching torrent is found, SeerrBridge automates the Real-Debrid download process.
4. **Queue Management**: Requests are added to a queue and processed one by one, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

If you want to see the automation working in real-time, you can edit the .env and set it to false

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1e9cdb-ff59-41fa-8a71-ccbff0f3c210)

This will launch a visible Chrome browser. Be sure not to mess with it while it's operating or else you will break the current action/script and need a re-run.

<summary>üì∫ TV Show Subscription Feature</summary>

SeerrBridge now includes an exciting **TV Show Subscription** feature that enhances its functionality for ongoing and currently airing TV shows! With this new addition, SeerrBridge takes automated media fetching to the next level:

### üîß How It Works:
- **Episode-Level Automation**: Automatically tracks and fetches **individual episodes** for ongoing TV shows, especially when a **complete season pack** is unavailable.
- **Smart Subscription System**:
    - Tracks currently airing episodes and **checks for new releases on a defined interval**.
    - Handles previously **missed or failed episode downloads**, ensuring nothing gets left behind.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works flawlessly with **Debrid Media Manager** and **Real-Debrid**, providing uninterrupted automation and caching requested episodes instantly when available.
- **Fully Automated**: Once subscribed to a show, SeerrBridge manages all episodes for you. No need to manually check for new episodes!

### üåü Key Benefits:
- **Never Miss an Episode**: Perfect for keeping up with currently airing shows where season packs are rare or unavailable during release cycles.
- **Optimized for Real-Debrid**: Ensures episodes are downloaded as soon as torrents are cached and accessible in your debrid account.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Any failed episode attempts are logged and automatically retried during the next interval check.

üéâ **This feature ensures you stay up to date on your favorite series‚Äîall fully automated!**

<summary>üéØ Custom Regex Filtering</summary>

This script includes support for **custom regex filtering**, allowing you to filter out unwanted items and refine the results based on specific patterns. The regex is automatically added when the script runs, and you can customize it directly in the code.

### Default Regex

The currently used regex is:

```python
^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

#### What It Does:
- **Exclude Items with `„Äê...„Äë`**: `(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)` removes items with formatted text in this style.
- **Exclude Cyrillic Characters**: `(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])` removes items containing characters from Cyrillic scripts (e.g., Russian text).
- **Exclude Items with `[esp]`**: `(?!.*\[esp\])` removes items explicitly marked as `[esp]` (often denoting Spanish content).
- **Match All Other Content**: `.*` ensures the filter applies to the rest of the string.

This is a broad exclusion-based filter that removes unwanted patterns without requiring specific inclusions.

---

### Optional Regex (Filtering by Resolution)

If you'd like to refine the filter further to only match items containing **1080p** or **2160p**, you can use the following optional regex:

```python
^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```

#### What It Does:
- **Include Only Items with `1080p` or `2160p`**: `(?=.*(1080p|2160p))` ensures that only items with these resolutions are processed.
- The rest of the filter (**exclude `„Äê...„Äë`, Cyrillic characters, or `[esp]`**) works the same as in the default regex.

---

### How to Use

To switch between the default and optional regex, simply update the `.env` file:

- **Default Regex**:
    ```python
    ^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
    ```

- **Optional Regex**:
    ```python
    ^(?=.*(1080p|2160p))(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
    ```

This gives you flexibility to define what gets filtered, based on your preferred criteria.
